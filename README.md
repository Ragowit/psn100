## What is PSN 100%?
PSN 100% is a trophy tracking website, focusing on merging game stacks and removing unobtainable trophies to create one list of only unique obtainable trophies so all users have the chance to compete for the same level, without the need to replay the same game multiple times or missed opportunities on trophies that are no longer available for one reason or another. Furthermore PSN 100% only calculates stats from the top 50k players in order to try and be more accurate for those who consider themselves as a trophy hunter. PSN 100% is made by trophy hunters, for trophy hunters.

## What isn't PSN 100%?
PSN 100% is not a community for discussion (forum), gaming/boosting sessions or trophy guides. Other sites already handle this with greatness, please use them.
